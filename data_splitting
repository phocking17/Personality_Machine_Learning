# This function accepts a series of objects containing:
# 	(A) Classification: A personality type
#	(B) Response answers as binary (or Boolean) values
# The program then splits the data into two lists, one
# containing training data and the other containing 
# test data. Appointment of data to its list is random,
# and all data should be accounted for. User inputs 
# should allow for setting the percentage of training 
# and test data, with a default value of 80 percent 
# training and 20 percent test. No error returns if 
# percentage does not evenly divide data set.
